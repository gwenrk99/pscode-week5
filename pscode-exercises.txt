// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a=5
b=10
c=sum
a+b=15

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number is / by 2
then number is even
else it is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

five numbers (a,b,c,d, and e)
a=2
b=7
c=20
d=15
e=24

a+b+c+d+e=sum/amount of numbers used=average
2+7+20+15+24=68/5=13.6

intgers: 2,7,20,15, and 24
if minimum of set of numbers = integer with lowest value  
if maximum of set of numbers = integer with greatest value
else: not minimum or maximum numbers 
minimum = 2 
maximum = 24  

To find the average of the five numbers, add all the numbers together then divide by the amount of numbers in the set of numbers. 
So, add the numbers 2, 7, 20, 15, and 24 together and then divide by 5 because there are five different numbers in the list of numbers. 
That gives you your answer. 

To find the minimum number look for the number with the lowest value in the group of numbers. To find the maximum number you look for the number that has the largest value in the group of numbers.
